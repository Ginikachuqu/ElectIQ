- Imports:
        React, { useState }: React and the useState hook for managing component state.
        { Link, useNavigate } from react-router-dom: These hooks enable navigation between different pages in the app and allow users to link to different routes.
        { useAuth } from ../../hooks/useAuth: A custom hook to manage authentication logic (e.g., signing in the user).
        toast from react-hot-toast: A library used to display notifications to users, such as success or error messages.

    Component Definition:
        const Signin = (props: Props) => { ... }: Defines the Signin component, accepting props but not using them in this implementation.

    State Initialization:
        const [formData, setFormData] = useState({ email: '', password: '' }): Initializes the state to store the email and password values entered by the user.

    Authentication Handling:
        const { signIn, isLoading } = useAuth(): Destructures the signIn function and isLoading state from the useAuth hook. signIn is used to authenticate the user, and isLoading tracks whether the sign-in process is ongoing.
        const navigate = useNavigate(): A hook to programmatically navigate the user to different routes within the app (e.g., redirecting after successful login).

    Form Submission (handleSignIn):
        The handleSignIn function is triggered when the user submits the form.
        It first prevents the default form submission with e.preventDefault().
        Then, it checks whether the email or password is empty. If so, an error toast is shown, and an error is thrown.
        If the fields are valid, it calls the signIn function with the email and password.
        Upon successful login (result.data), a success toast is shown, and the user is navigated to the home page (navigate('/')).
        If an error occurs (result.error), an error toast is shown with the error message.

    JSX Return (UI Rendering):
        The component returns JSX that represents the user interface for the sign-in page:
            A form with fields for entering the email and password.
            A sign-in button that triggers the handleSignIn function.
            A loading indicator on the button when isLoading is true, showing an SVG spinner.
            Links for navigating to the sign-up page and a forgotten password page.

    The form elements use controlled components, meaning their values are managed by React state (formData.email and formData.password), and updates to the input fields trigger setFormData to update the state.

    Error Handling:
        If there is an error during the sign-in process (e.g., invalid credentials), an error message is displayed using the toast.error function.

    Styling:
        The component uses utility-first CSS classes from the tailwindcss framework to style the form, buttons, and layout.

Key Features:

   Controlled Inputs: The email and password input fields are controlled by React's useState hook, ensuring that the form data is kept in sync with the component state.
    User Feedback: Success and error messages are shown to the user via toast notifications.
    Loading State: A spinner is displayed on the sign-in button when the sign-in process is ongoing.
    Error Handling: The form checks for missing email or password fields and provides feedback to the user.
    Navigation: Upon successful sign-in, the user is navigated to the home page.

Additional Notes:

   The Signin component is designed to be part of a larger application with user authentication and routing.
    The useAuth hook is responsible for managing the authentication logic, including API calls for user login.
